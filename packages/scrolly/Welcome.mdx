# Welcome to Scrolly

Scrolly is a small set of React helpers that wrap GSAP scroll animation patterns.
It focuses on practical primitives like pinned stages and scroll-linked timelines.

- GitHub: https://github.com/waynegraham/scrolly-lab
- NPM (not published yet): https://www.npmjs.com/package/@waynegraham/scrolly

## Basic setup

Install dependencies for the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm -w install
```

Build the package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @waynegraham/scrolly build
```

Use it in your app:

```tsx
import { PinnedStage, useScrollTimeline } from "@waynegraham/scrolly";
```

## Dependency notes

- `@waynegraham/scrolly` ships with peer dependencies on `react`, `react-dom`,
  `gsap`, and `@gsap/react`. Make sure those are installed in your consuming app.
- The repo uses `pnpm` workspaces and is not published to npm yet, so local
  development relies on workspace linking instead of a registry install.
- Node.js 20+ and `pnpm@10.x` are required for the monorepo tooling.

## Suggestions to make this easier to manage

- Add `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` fields to `packages/scrolly/package.json`
  so npm metadata and docs pages point to the right place when publishing.
- Add a short "Publishing" section that documents the `changeset` workflow and
  how peer dependency versions should be kept in sync with the docs app.
